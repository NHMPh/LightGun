### 2. **Hardware Set Up**  
The light gun comprises a toy gun, a compact USB webcam (OV9726) and a USB mouse.

The camera is mounted on the barrel, while a switch is securely attached behind the trigger.

The switch is soldered to the PCB, replacing the mouse's left-click

  - #### 2 Enable the overlay border
     Hold ``LeftCtrl + B`` to enable the overlay border.

     Hold ``LeftCtrl + B`` again to turn it off.

     You can also set the border width to make it more visiable.

     Note: The border will not be visible if the game is in ***fullscreen mode***. Ensure that the game is set to either windowed mode or borderless windowed mode.
     
  - #### 3 Configure the webcam property

    ** THE LIGHT GUN'S CAMERA NEED TO SEE THE WHITE BORDER EVERY FRAME**
    
     Ensure that the camera can consistently detect the white border on the screen. You should experiment with the threshold, contrast, gamma, and exposure settings to achieve optimal performance.

     You also need to make sure that the light gun's camera is at  [****(1+1/2) * your screen width****] away from your screen.

     Try to move your gun rapidly and adjust the webcam property accordingly.
    
  - #### 4 Start and calibrate the gun

    Start your gun by holding  ``LeftShift + B``

    Note: This will take over your current mouse.
    
    Use your gun sight to adjust the mouse cursor position by clicking/shooting on the (+10 -10 +1 -1) buttons

 - #### 5 Have fun
   Be sure to turn on the overlay border when you start your game and save your setting and.
   
   Tips: Open your game and then hold ``LeftCtrl + B`` to enable the overlay border. Then hold ``LeftShift + B`` to start the light gun.

   You can also customize what input will be send when you click/shoot outside of the screen and the border width here.

   I recommend THOTD2, THOTD3, hotd overkill, or any light gun games that can be control with a usb mouse.
